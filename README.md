# client-server

### Project Summary
Main concept here is that client and server communicate conventionally. For example, a client sends a request and the server replies.

The program function is to mimic the basic stock market scenario, where users can join the stock market and a user with the stock can decide to give to the other live users.

Please note that there are 4 projects, server and client written in C# and Java. You can mix and match the server and client which can still talk to each other. E.g. You can pick C# server while Java client and both will be able to communicate with each other.
